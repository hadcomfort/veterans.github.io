title: Veterans' Preference Guide

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) administers entitlement to veterans' preference in
employment under title 5, United States Code, and oversees other statutory employment requirements in
titles 5 and 38. (Title 38 also governs Veterans' entitlement to benefits administered by the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA).)
Both title 5 and title 38 use many of the same terms, but in different ways. For example, service during a
"war" is used to determine entitlement to Veterans' preference and service credit under title 5. OPM has
always interpreted this to mean a war declared by Congress. But title 38 defines "period of war" to
include many non-declared wars, including Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. Such conflicts entitle a
veteran to VA benefits under title 38, but not necessarily to preference or service credit under title 5.
Thus it is critically important to use the correct definitions in determining eligibility for specific rights and
benefits in employment.
