This document, 'VET GUIDE FOR HR PROFESSIONALS' from OPM.gov, serves as a comprehensive guide for Human Resources professionals regarding U.S. veterans' services and preferences in Federal employment. It details the policies and procedures administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under titles 5 and 38 of the United States Code. Key areas covered include:
*   **Veterans' Preference:** Explanation of why preference is given, when it applies, different types (0-point, 5-point, 10-point including derived preferences), and its application in appointments, competitive examinations (including Category Rating and Rule of Three), and Reduction in Force (RIF).
*   **Special Provisions & Appointing Authorities:** Details on the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) Act, crediting of experience, waivers for qualifications, excepted service employment, and special appointing authorities like the Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) and provisions for disabled veterans.
*   **Rights and Protections:** Information on restoration rights after uniformed service, service credit, appeal rights, and protections against adverse actions.
*   **Administrative Guidance:** Procedures for adjudicating claims, handling late applications, and understanding the impact of military retirement on benefits.
The guide also includes appendices that list qualifying wars, campaigns, and expeditions; types of uniformed service eligible for preference; officer personnel pay grades; and a historical overview of Veterans' Preference legislation. Its primary aim is to equip HR professionals with the necessary knowledge to correctly apply laws and regulations related to veteran employment in the Federal sector.
