## Why Preference is Given
Since the time of the Civil War, veterans of the Armed Forces have been given some degree of preference in
appointments to Federal jobs. Recognizing their sacrifice, Congress enacted laws to prevent veterans seeking
Federal employment from being penalized for their time in military service. Veterans' preference recognizes
the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country in uniform, restores veterans to a
favorable competitive position for Government employment, and acknowledges the larger obligation owed to
disabled veterans.
Veterans' preference in its present form comes from the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, as amended, and is
now codified in various provisions of title 5, United States Code. By law, veterans who are disabled or who
served on active duty in the Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in military campaigns are
entitled to preference over others in hiring from competitive lists of eligibles and also in retention during
reductions in force.
In addition to receiving preference in competitive appointments, veterans may be considered for special
noncompetitive appointments for which only they are eligible. See Chapter 4.

## When Preference Applies
Preference in hiring applies to permanent and temporary positions in the competitive and excepted services
of the executive branch. Preference does not apply to positions in the Senior Executive Service or to
executive branch positions for which Senate confirmation is required. The legislative and judicial branches of
the Federal Government also are exempt from the Veterans' Preference Act unless the positions are in the
competitive service (Government Printing Office, for example) or have been made subject to the Act by
another law.
Preference applies in hiring from civil service examinations conducted by the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) and agencies under delegated examining authority, for most excepted service jobs
including Veterans Recruitment Appointments (VRA), and when agencies make temporary, term, and
overseas limited appointments. Veterans' preference does not apply to promotion, reassignment, change to
lower grade, transfer or reinstatement.
Veterans' preference does not require an agency to use any particular appointment process. Agencies have
broad authority under law to hire from any appropriate source of eligibles including special appointing
authorities. An agency may consider candidates already in the civil service from an agency-developed merit
promotion list or it may reassign a current employee, transfer an employee from another agency, or reinstate
a former Federal employee. In addition, agencies are required to give priority to displaced employees before
using civil service examinations and similar hiring methods.
