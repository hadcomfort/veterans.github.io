            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>This website serves as a General Veterans Information Portal, with a primary focus on providing a comprehensive guide to Veterans' Preference in federal employment. Our purpose is to offer clear, accessible information to veterans, their families, and Human Resources (HR) personnel to help them understand these important benefits and related resources.</p>

            <h2>How This Site is Organized</h2>
            <p>This website has two main parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>General Veterans Information Portal (Main Site):</strong> The primary landing page and associated sections (Healthcare, Education, Employment, Housing) provide an overview of various veteran resources and link to key official government information.</li>
                <li><strong>Veterans' Preference Guide:</strong> A detailed guide specifically focused on Veterans' Preference in federal hiring. This section explains eligibility, types of preference, how it's applied, and includes an interactive assessment tool.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Source of Information</h2>
            <p>The content related to Veterans' Preference is largely based on the official <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals</a>, published by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). We strive to ensure the information presented is accurate and reflects official guidance.</p>
            <p>The information in the general resources sections (Healthcare, Education, Employment, Housing) is curated from and links directly to official government websites such as VA.gov, DOL.gov, and HUD.gov.</p>

            <h2>Unofficial Informational Resource</h2>
            <p>Please note that this website is an unofficial informational resource. While we aim for accuracy, the content provided here does not constitute legal advice or an official determination of eligibility for any benefits.

            <h2>Contributing</h2>
