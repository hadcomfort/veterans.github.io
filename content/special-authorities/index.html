            <section>
                <p>In addition to Veterans' Preference in competitive examinations and appointments, several special appointing authorities allow agencies to hire veterans, sometimes noncompetitively. These authorities recognize the unique skills and sacrifices of veterans and aim to facilitate their entry into Federal service.</p>

                <h2>Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) Authority</h2>
                <p>The VRA is a special authority allowing agencies to appoint eligible veterans without competition to positions up to GS-11 or equivalent. VRA appointees are hired under excepted appointments to positions that are otherwise in the competitive service. There's no limit to the number of VRA appointments an individual can receive if eligible.</p>
                <p>If an agency has multiple VRA candidates and one or more is preference eligible, Veterans' Preference procedures (5 CFR Part 302) must be applied. A VRA-eligible veteran is not automatically eligible for Veterans' Preference points.</p>
                <p>After two years of satisfactory service, the agency must convert the VRA appointee to a career or career-conditional appointment.</p>
                <h3>Eligibility Criteria for VRA</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disabled veterans; or</li>
                    <li>Veterans who served on active duty during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; or</li>
                    <li>Veterans who, while on active duty, participated in a U.S. military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded; or</li>
                    <li>Recently separated veterans.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Veterans must have been separated under honorable conditions (honorable or general discharge). Not all 5-point preference eligibles are VRA eligible.</p>
                <h3>Making VRA Appointments</h3>
                <p>Agencies can appoint any VRA eligible who meets basic qualifications without announcing the job. However, if there are multiple VRA candidates, and one or more is preference eligible, preference must be applied. Agencies must consider all VRA candidates on file for the position.</p>
                <h3>Terms and Conditions of Employment</h3>
                <p>VRA appointees can be promoted, demoted, reassigned, or transferred like career employees. Time-in-grade requirements apply for promotions, but an agency can give a new VRA appointment at a higher grade (up to GS-11) without regard to time-in-grade if the employee is qualified. Agencies must establish a training/education program for VRA appointees with less than 15 years of education.</p>
                <h3>Appeal Rights</h3>
                <p>During the first year, VRA appointees have limited appeal rights similar to competitive service probationers. Otherwise, they have appeal rights of excepted service employees. Preference eligible VRAs gain adverse action protections after one year; non-preference eligible VRAs after two years of continuous service.</p>
                <h3>Nonpermanent Appointment Based on VRA Eligibility</h3>
                <p>Agencies can make noncompetitive temporary or term appointments based on VRA eligibility. These are not VRA appointments and do not lead to conversion.</p>

                <h2>30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans</h2>
                <p>Agencies may give a noncompetitive temporary appointment (more than 60 days) or a term appointment to any veteran:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Retired from active military service with a disability rating of 30 percent or more; OR</li>
                    <li>Rated by the VA (since 1991 or later, or by Armed Forces at any time) as having a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There is no grade level limitation, but the appointee must meet all qualification requirements, including any written tests. The agency may convert the employee to a career or career-conditional appointment at any time during the temporary or term appointment without a break in service.</p>

                <h2>Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program</h2>
                <p>Disabled veterans eligible for training under the VA vocational rehabilitation program may enroll for training or work experience at an agency through an agreement between the agency and VA. While in the program, the veteran is a VA beneficiary, not a Federal employee for most purposes.</p>
                <p>Training is tailored to individual needs. If intended to prepare for appointment, the agency must ensure the training will enable the veteran to meet qualification requirements. Upon successful completion, the veteran receives a Certificate of Training, allowing any agency to appoint them noncompetitively under a status quo appointment, which can be converted to career or career-conditional.</p>

                <h2>Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA)</h2>
                <p>VEOA allows preference eligibles or eligible veterans to apply for positions announced under merit promotion procedures when an agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce. A VEOA eligible selected under merit promotion procedures receives a career or career-conditional appointment. Veterans' preference points are not a factor in these VEOA merit promotion appointments.</p>
                <h3>Eligibility Requirements for VEOA</h3>
                <p>An applicant must be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A preference eligible; OR</li>
                    <li>A veteran separated from the armed forces after 3 or more years of continuous active service performed under honorable conditions. (Veterans released shortly before completing a 3-year tour are generally considered eligible).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Terms and Conditions of Employment</h3>
                <p>Employees appointed under VEOA are subject to a probationary period and agency merit promotion plan requirements.</p>
                <h3>Appeal Rights</h3>
                <p>Employees appointed in the competitive service have competitive service appeal rights.</p>
                <h3>VEOA and Vacancy Announcements</h3>
                <p>VEOA provides access and opportunity, not an entitlement to a position. Agencies have options for announcing positions when recruiting externally:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Merit Promotion "Internal" Announcement:</strong> Must include VEOA consideration information. VEOA eligibles are rated with other merit promotion candidates; preference points do not apply.</li>
                    <li><strong>Delegated Examining Unit (DEU) "External" Announcement for "All Sources":</strong> VEOA eligibles are treated like any other applicant. If qualified and reachable, they are referred on the DEU list.</li>
                    <li><strong>Two Separate Announcements (DEU and Merit Promotion):</strong> VEOA eligibles can apply for both and must be considered on both lists if eligible.</li>
                </ul>
