                <h1>Wars, Campaigns and Expeditions of the Armed Forces Since WW II</h1>
<h2>Which Qualify for Veterans Preference</h2>
<p>War Service Creditable for Veterans Preference. In the absence of statutory definition for "war" and</p>
<p>"campaign or expedition," OPM considers to be "wars" only those armed conflicts for which a declaration of</p>
<p>war was issued by Congress. The title 38, U.S.C., definition of "period of war," which is used in determining</p>
<p>benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, includes the Vietnam Era and other armed</p>
<p>conflicts. That title 38 definition is NOT applicable for civil service purposes.</p>
<p>Thus the last "war" for which active duty is qualifying for Veterans preference is World War II. The inclusive</p>
<p>dates for World War II service are December 7, 1941, through April 28, 1952.</p>
<p>Non-combat operations that are not qualifying for Veterans preference. Many medals are</p>
<p>awarded for non-combat operations. These medals are not a basis for preference and include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global War on Terrorism Service Medal for service from September 11, 2001, to date to be determined.</li>
<li>The Medal of Merit for meritorious service in World War II.</li>
<li>The Medal of Freedom for meritorious achievements or meritorious service to the United States on or</li>
<li>after December 7, 1941, in the war against an enemy outside the continental limits of the United</li>
<li>States.</li>
<li>The Antarctica Service Medal for participating in a scientific, direct support, or exploratory operation</li>
<li>on the Antarctic Continent.</li>
<li>The National Defense Service Medal for honorable service between June 27, 1950 and July 27, 1954 or</li>
<li>January 1, 1961 and August 14, 1974; or for the period between August 2, 1990, and November 30,</li>
<li>1995.</li>
<li>The Armed Forces Service Medal for participation in a United States military operation deemed to be a</li>
<li>significant activity for which there was no threat of encounter of foreign armed opposition or</li>
<li>imminent threat of hostile action.</li>
<li>The Armed Forces Reserve Medal for 10 years of honorable service in a Reserve component; or active</li>
<li>duty service in a Reserve component on or after August 1, 1990; or volunteer service for active duty on</li>
<li>after August 1, 1990.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Military Operations Since 1937 for Which a Campaign or Expeditionary Medal Has Been</h3>
<p>Awarded, Except for Operations Occurring During a Declared War</p>
<p>Military personnel receive many awards and decorations. To help agencies make decisions concerning</p>
<p>entitlement to Veterans preference and other benefits, the following list identifies those awards that are</p>
<p>campaign and expeditionary medals. Any Armed Forces expeditionary Medal, whether listed here</p>
<p>or not, is qualifying for Veterans preference. The Department of Defense, not OPM, determines who</p>
<p>is entitled to receive a medal, and under what circumstances. The list below is derived from DoD 1348.33-M,</p>
<p>Manual of Military Decorations and Awards.</p>
<p>DD 214, Certificate of Discharge or Separation from Active Duty, or other official documents issued by the</p>
<p>branch of service are required as verification of eligibility for Veterans preference.</p>
