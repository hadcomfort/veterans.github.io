            <section>
                <p>Veterans have advantages over non-veterans in a reduction in force (RIF). Special provisions also apply in determining whether retired military members receive preference in RIF and whether their military service is counted. This section primarily deals with RIF in the competitive service; some, but not all, provisions apply in the excepted service.</p>

                <h2>Eligibility for Veterans' Preference in RIF</h2>
                <p>Determinations of Veterans' preference eligibility for RIF purposes are generally made in accordance with standard preference eligibility rules, with an additional condition for retired members of a uniformed service. This condition varies by rank at retirement.</p>
                <p>"Uniformed service" includes the Armed Forces, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
                <h3>Retirees Below the Rank of Major (or Equivalent)</h3>
                <p>These retirees receive preference if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Retirement from the uniformed service is based on a disability that resulted from injury or disease received in the line of duty as a direct result of armed conflict, or was caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in the line of duty during a period of war (as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(11), including WWII, Korean conflict, Vietnam era, Persian Gulf War, or future declared wars); OR</li>
                    <li>The employee's retired pay is not based on 20 or more years of full-time active service (excluding active duty for training); OR</li>
                    <li>The employee has been continuously employed in a position covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 35 since November 30, 1964, without a break in service of more than 30 days.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Retirees At or Above the Rank of Major (or Equivalent)</h3>
                <p>These retirees receive preference if they are disabled veterans (XP, CP, or CPS) AND also meet one of the criteria listed above for those retired below the rank of Major.</p>
                <p>A preference eligible who at age 60 becomes eligible for retired pay as a reservist and who retires at or above the rank of Major (or equivalent) is considered a preference eligible for RIF purposes at age 60 only if he or she is a disabled veteran. Until age 60, a reservist not yet receiving retired pay is considered a preference eligible if otherwise eligible.</p>

                <h2>RIF Retention Standing</h2>
                <p>Employees are ranked on retention registers for competitive levels (groups of similar jobs) based on four factors: tenure, Veterans' preference, length of service, and performance.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Tenure Group:</strong> Employees are placed in Group I, II, or III depending on their type of appointment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Veterans' Preference Subgroup:</strong> Within each tenure group, they are placed in a subgroup:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Subgroup AD:</strong> Preference eligibles with a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more.</li>
                            <li><strong>Subgroup A:</strong> All other preference eligibles (including derived preference).</li>
                            <li><strong>Subgroup B:</strong> Non-preference eligibles.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Service Length:</strong> Within each subgroup, employees are ranked by their creditable Federal civilian and military service, augmented by performance ratings.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When a position is abolished, the employee affected is the one who stands lowest on the retention register. Veterans are listed ahead of non-veterans within each tenure group, making them last to be affected by a RIF.</p>
                <p><strong>Protection during Uniformed Service:</strong> Employees are not subject to RIF while serving in the uniformed services. Upon return, they are protected: for 1 year if service was over 180 days, and for 6 months if service was 31-180 days.</p>

                <h2>Assignment Rights (Bump and Retreat)</h2>
                <p>When an employee in Tenure Group I or II with a minimally successful performance rating is released from a competitive level, they may be entitled to displace another employee with lower retention standing. These rights apply in the competitive service; agencies may adopt similar provisions for excepted employees.</p>
                <h3>Bumping</h3>
                <p>An employee may "bump" to a position in the same competitive area no more than three grades (or grade intervals) lower than their current position, if that position is held by an employee in a lower group or subgroup.</p>
                <h3>Retreating</h3>
                <p>An employee may "retreat" to a position in the same competitive area held by another employee with lower retention standing in the same tenure group and subgroup if that position is essentially identical to one previously held by the retreating employee and is no more than three grades (or grade intervals) lower.
                A preference eligible with a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more may retreat to a position up to five grades (or grade intervals) lower.</p>
                <p>An employee with an unacceptable performance rating has no right to bump or retreat. An employee with a minimally successful rating may retreat only to positions held by an employee with the same or lower rating.</p>

                <h2>Qualifications for RIF Assignment</h2>
                <p>In reviewing a preference eligible's qualifications for assignment rights in a RIF, the agency must waive requirements as described under Physical Qualifications. If the veteran has a 30% or more compensable disability, special procedures apply, and OPM must approve the sufficiency of an agency's reasons to medically disqualify such a veteran for assignment to another position in a RIF.</p>

                <h2>Appeal of RIF Actions</h2>
                <p>An employee who has been furloughed, separated, or demoted by RIF action generally has the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), unless a negotiated grievance procedure must be used. Assignment to a position at the employee's same grade or representative rate is not appealable. Appeals must typically be filed within 30 days after the effective date of the RIF action.</p>

                <h2>Reemployment Priority for Separated Employees</h2>
                <p>Separated competitive service employees in tenure groups I and II are listed on the agency's Reemployment Priority List (RPL). The agency generally may not hire from most outside sources when qualified employees are on the RPL. In hiring from the List, preference eligibles receive preference over other employees. Excepted service employees separated by RIF receive similar priority in excepted employment.</p>
