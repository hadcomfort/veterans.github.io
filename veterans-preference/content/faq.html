                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Below are some frequently asked questions about Veterans' Preference. If your question is not listed here, please consult the relevant sections of this guide or the official OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals.</p>

                <h3>General Eligibility & Application</h3>

                <details>
                    <summary>What does "active duty" mean for Veterans' Preference? Does it include training?</summary>
                    <p>For most veterans, "active duty" for preference purposes means full-time duty in the Armed Forces, other than active duty for training. However, for disabled veterans, "active duty" *does* include training service in the Reserves or National Guard. (Source: 5 U.S.C. 2108)</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can a military retiree at a high rank (Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher) receive Veterans' Preference in appointments?</summary>
                    <p>Generally, military retirees at the rank of Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher are not eligible for preference in appointments *unless* they are disabled veterans. This rule does not apply to Reservists who will not begin drawing military retired pay until age 60. (Source: 5 U.S.C. 2108)</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>When does Veterans' Preference apply in hiring?</summary>
                    <p>Preference in hiring applies to permanent and temporary positions in the competitive and excepted services of the executive branch. It does not apply to positions in the Senior Executive Service or to executive branch positions for which Senate confirmation is required. Preference applies in hiring from civil service examinations, for most excepted service jobs (including VRAs), and when agencies make temporary, term, and overseas limited appointments.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Does Veterans' Preference apply to promotions or transfers?</summary>
                    <p>No, Veterans' preference does not apply to promotion, reassignment, change to lower grade, transfer or reinstatement actions for current federal employees.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What is the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act certification?</summary>
                    <p>A “certification” under the VOW Act is any written document from the armed forces that certifies a service member is expected to be discharged or released from active duty service under honorable conditions within 120 days after the certification is submitted. The certification letter should be on letterhead of the appropriate military branch and contain (1) the military service dates including the expected discharge or release date; and (2) the character of service. Agencies must accept this in lieu of a DD Form 214 for application purposes, but the DD Form 214 will be required for appointment.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What is 0-point Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP)?</summary>
                    <p>Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP) is for veterans released or discharged from active duty after August 29, 2008, due to a "sole survivorship discharge." These individuals do not receive points but are entitled to be listed ahead of non-preference eligibles with the same score or in the same quality category. They also have the same pass-over rights and can credit military experience to meet job qualifications.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How is military service experience credited for preference eligibles during examinations?</summary>
                    <p>For preference eligibles, an examining office must credit Armed Forces service as an extension of work performed immediately prior to service, or based on actual duties performed in service, or as a combination of both, whichever would most benefit the applicant. All applicants also get credit for other job-related paid/unpaid experience (e.g., religious, civic, welfare, service and organizational activities).</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Can medical or physical requirements be waived for a preference eligible?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, agencies must waive a medical standard or physical requirement when there is sufficient evidence that the applicant or employee, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential duties of the position without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others. Special provisions apply to the proposed disqualification of a preference eligible with a 30 percent or more compensable disability.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Do maximum entry-age restrictions apply to preference eligibles?</summary>
                    <p>Qualified preference eligibles may apply and be considered for vacancies regardless of whether they meet maximum age requirements identified at 5 U.S.C. 3307 (e.g., for Law Enforcement Officers). An agency must waive a maximum entry-age requirement unless age is essential to the performance of the position. If waived, the corresponding mandatory retirement age may also be higher. This applies to positions such as firefighters, air traffic controllers, U.S. Park police, nuclear materials couriers, and customs and border patrol officers.</p>
                </details>

                <h3>Derived Preference</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>What is "derived preference" for a spouse of a disabled veteran?</summary>
                    <p>10 points can be added to the passing examination score of a spouse of a disabled veteran if the veteran is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability. This disqualification is often presumed if the veteran is rated 100% disabled/unemployable by the VA, has retired/resigned from civil service due to a service-connected disability, or has failed to qualify for jobs in their usual occupation due to the disability. (Source: 5 U.S.C. 2108)</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can a widow/widower of a veteran receive preference?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, 10 points can be added to the passing score of a widow or widower of a veteran if they were not divorced, have not remarried (or the remarriage was annulled), and the veteran either served during a war, specific peacetime periods (April 28, 1952 - July 1, 1955), or in a campaign/expedition for which a medal was authorized, OR died while on active duty under honorable conditions during such service. (Source: 5 U.S.C. 2108)</p>
                </details>

                <h3>How Preference is Applied</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>How does the "Rule of Three" work with Veterans' Preference?</summary>
                    <p>When using numerical ranking (Rule of Three), selection must generally be made from the highest three available eligibles on a certificate. However, an agency cannot pass over a preference eligible to select a lower-ranking non-preference eligible or a non-preference eligible with the same or lower score, unless specific objection procedures are followed. (Source: 5 U.S.C. 3318; 5 CFR 332.404)</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What is Category Rating and how does preference apply?</summary>
                    <p>Under category rating, applicants meeting minimum qualifications are placed into quality categories instead of a numerical rank. Preference eligibles are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles within each quality category. Veterans' preference is absolute within each category, meaning agencies must generally select a preference eligible over a non-preference eligible within the same category. (Source: 5 U.S.C. 3319)</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What are the special provisions for passing over or disqualifying a veteran with a 30% or more compensable disability?</summary>
                    <p>If an agency proposes to pass over such a disabled veteran to select a non-preference eligible, or to disqualify them based on physical requirements, it must notify both OPM and the veteran. The veteran has 15 days to respond to OPM. OPM then makes the final determination on the veteran's ability to perform the job, and the agency must comply with OPM's decision. OPM cannot delegate this authority. (Source: 5 U.S.C. 3312, 3318)</p>
                </details>

                <h3>Special Appointing Authorities & Other Provisions</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>What is a Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA)?</summary>
                    <p>VRA is a special authority allowing agencies to appoint eligible veterans without competition to positions up to GS-11 (or equivalent). It's an excepted appointment that can be converted to career/career-conditional after two years of satisfactory service. Preference applies if there are multiple VRA candidates for one job. (Source: 5 CFR Part 307)</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Who is eligible for a VRA?</summary>
                    <p>VRA eligibility includes: disabled veterans; veterans who served on active duty during a war or in a campaign/expedition for which a badge was authorized; veterans who participated in a U.S. military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded; or recently separated veterans. Separation must be under honorable conditions. (Source: 38 U.S.C. 4214; 5 CFR Part 307)</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What are restoration rights after returning from uniformed service?</summary>
                    <p>Federal employees who perform duty with a uniformed service are generally entitled to be restored to the position they would have attained had they not left, provided they gave advance notice, were released under honorable conditions, served no more than a cumulative 5 years (with exceptions), and apply for restoration within set time limits. (Source: 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43; 5 CFR Part 353)</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Are any jobs restricted specifically to preference eligibles?</summary>
                    <p>Appointment through competitive examination and "outside the register" procedures for positions of guards, elevator operators, messengers, and custodians are restricted to preference eligibles when they are available.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Do preference eligibles have special reinstatement eligibility to federal jobs?</summary>
                    <p>Preference eligibles, including those with derived preference, who served under career or career-conditional appointment for any period of time have lifetime reinstatement eligibility to any competitive service position for which qualified. Competition under the agency's merit promotion plan is required if the position is at a higher grade level or has more promotion potential than a position previously held.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Is there a waiting period for retired military members to be appointed to civilian DoD positions?</summary>
                    <p>A retired member of the Armed Forces may not be appointed to a civilian position in DOD (including a nonappropriated fund position) within 180 days after retirement unless: the Secretary concerned authorizes the appointment; or the position is authorized special pay under 5 U.S.C. 5305; or a state of national emergency exists. OPM has delegated the authority to DOD to make these determinations.</p>
                </details>

                <h3>Gulf War Preference</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>What does "otherwise eligible" mean for Gulf War preference (service from Aug 2, 1990, to Jan 2, 1992)?</summary>
                    <p>It means the person must have been separated from the service under honorable conditions and have served continuously for a minimum of 24 months or the full period for which called or ordered to active duty. This is in addition to other general eligibility requirements for preference. For example, retired officers at the rank of Major or above are generally not eligible unless they are disabled veterans.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Which law specifies the 24-month service requirement for Gulf War preference for those who enlisted after September 7, 1980?</summary>
                    <p>The 24-month service requirement is found in Section 5303A of Title 38, United States Code, which defines the minimum active-duty service requirement for those who initially enter active duty after September 7, 1980.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can an applicant claim preference based on Gulf War service that occurred after January 2, 1992?</summary>
                    <p>No. The law specifies that only those on active duty during the period beginning August 2, 1990, and ending January 2, 1992, are eligible for preference based on this specific provision. Applicants who served on active duty exclusively after these dates would need to qualify for preference through other means, such as receiving a campaign badge or expeditionary medal for their service, or by meeting other service period requirements.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Are there any plans to extend Veterans' preference to any other groups of individuals who served on active duty during times of conflict that may not have served in specific theaters of operation?</summary>
                    <p>We are not aware of any plans to extend Veterans' preference to any other group of individuals.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>An applicant is claiming preference based on service in Bosnia, but he/she has no DD Form 214 to support his claim. Can we give him/her preference?</summary>
                    <p>A service member whose record appears to show service qualifying for Veterans' preference (for example, there is an indication that the person served in Bosnia in 1996), may be accorded 5 points tentative preference on that basis alone. However, before the person can be appointed, he or she must submit proof of entitlement to preference. That proof may be an amended DD Form 214 showing the award of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (AFEM) for Bosnia in the case of service members who served there and were released prior to enactment of the recent Veterans' preference amendments, or it may be other official documentation showing award of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>How are we to know that a Reservist was, in fact, a) called to active duty, and b) served the full period for which called? Don't some Reservists just receive a letter telling them they are being placed on active duty?</summary>
                    <p>A Reservist will always have orders placing him (or her) on active duty -- (it is the only way the Reservist can be paid). While the individual may also have a letter saying that he or she is being called up, there will always be orders backing this up. Similarly, when the Reservist is released from active duty, he or she will always have separation or demobilization orders.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Several employees have come to the agency personnel office claiming they should have preference under the new law, but they have no proof of service during the specified period. We are getting ready to issue Reduction In Force (RIF) notices. Should we take the employees' word for it or wait until they have proof?</summary>
                    <p>The employees cannot be given Veterans' preference without required documentation. The agency should work with the employee and the appropriate military service record organizations to obtain this documentation as soon as possible to avoid having to "rerun" the Reduction In Force at the last minute.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>If our agency has "frozen" personnel actions and issued Reduction In Force notices but the Reduction In Force effective date has not yet arrived, how can we account for any changes in Veterans' preference status?</summary>
                    <p>Regardless of where you are in the process of carrying out the Reduction In Force, you must correct the Veterans' preference of employees who will now be eligible as a result of the statute. Veterans' preference cannot be "frozen" like qualifications or performance appraisals--it must be corrected right up until the day of the Reduction In Force. If a change in preference results in a different outcome for one or more employees, amended Reduction In Force notices must be issued. If such a change results in a worse offer, the affected employee must be given a full 60/120 day notice period required by regulation. This may require the agency to use a temporary exception to keep one or more employees on the rolls past the Reduction In Force effective date in order to meet this obligation.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Our agency already completed a Reduction In Force effective November 28, 1997. There is at least one separated employee who would now have Veterans' preference and would not have been separated if we had known about the change in statute. What do we do now?</summary>
                    <p>If an agency finds that an eligible employee reached for Reduction In Force separation or downgrading effective on or after November 18, 1997, was not provided retention preference consistent with P.L. 105-85, The Office of Personnel Management recommends that the agency take appropriate corrective action. An employee not provided appropriate retention preference may appeal the Reduction In Force action to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). MSPB normally requires the appeal to be filed within 30 days of the Reduction In Force effective date, but Merit Systems Protection Board may, at its option, accept later appeals filed within 30 days of the employee becoming aware of the change. If an employee was separated or downgraded by Reduction In Force, the agency should determine whether or not the employee would have been affected differently based on the change in Veterans' preference. If the employee would still be separated or downgraded, the agency should correct the employee's notice. If the employee was separated, the agency should also correct the Reemployment Priority List (RPL) registration (if any) to accurately reflect their Veterans' preference. If the corrective action results in a surplus of employees in one or more competitive levels, the agency may have to run a new Reduction In Force. However, the agency cannot retroactively adjust the results of the prior Reduction In Force.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>What if an employee would have been registered as a I-A on the agency's Reemployment Priority List due to the new law, but has been listed as a I-B? What is the agency's obligation to make up for any lost consideration as a result?</summary>
                    <p>The employee's registration status on the Reemployment Priority List should be corrected immediately so that the employee will be considered as a I-A for the remainder of their time on the Reemployment Priority List. If the agency finds that a lower standing person was selected over the employee, the agency must notify the employee of the selection and their right to appeal to Merit Systems Protection Board. If the employee files a Reemployment Priority List appeal, Merit Systems Protection Board may order a retroactive remedy which could include extending the employee's time period for consideration under the Reemployment Priority List.</p>
                </details>

                <h3>Documentation & Process</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>An applicant is claiming preference based on service in Bosnia but has no DD Form 214. Can they be given preference?</summary>
                    <p>A service member whose record appears to show service qualifying for Veterans' preference (e.g., service in Bosnia in 1996) may be accorded 5 points tentative preference. However, before appointment, they must submit proof of entitlement. This could be an amended DD Form 214 showing the award of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (AFEM) for Bosnia or other official documentation showing the award.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How can an agency verify if a Reservist was called to active duty and served the full period?</summary>
                    <p>A Reservist will always have orders placing them on active duty (this is necessary for payment). Similarly, upon release from active duty, they will have separation or demobilization orders. These official orders serve as proof of active duty service and its duration.</p>

                <h3>Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA)</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>Does Veterans' Preference (e.g., adding points) apply to appointments under VEOA?</summary>
                    <p>No. Veterans' preference points are not applied to merit promotion actions, which is how VEOA candidates are considered. VEOA provides access and opportunity to apply for jobs announced under merit promotion procedures when the agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce; it is not a guarantee of selection or an application of preference points.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can VEOA candidates be considered for temporary or term positions?</summary>
                    <p>No. Because VEOA mandates that eligible veterans be given career or career-conditional appointments, temporary or term appointments cannot be offered under this authority.</p>
                </details>

                 <details>
                    <summary>To be eligible for a VEOA appointment, must a veteran be already separated from service?</summary>
                    <p>No. Whether or not to consider someone still in the military is at the discretion of the employing agency. While a person on active military duty cannot be appointed to a civilian position (unless on terminal leave), they can be considered if the agency wishes. The determining factor is whether the person will be available when the agency needs the job filled.</p>

                    <summary>Do the amendments made by Pub. L. 106-117 mean that agencies may no longer use authority code YKB/SchB 213.3202(n) to appoint eligible veterans under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA)?</summary>
                    <p>As of the date of enactment of the new amendments (November 30, 1999), agencies should not make any new appointments under the Schedule B authority. However, we are allowing a 1-month grace period to cover any appointments under the Schedule B authority that may already have been in progress.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>If VEOA-eligible veterans should no longer be appointed under the above Schedule B authority, how are they appointed?</summary>
                    <p>The law provides that preference eligibles or eligible veterans who compete under agency Merit Promotion procedures open to candidates outside the agency ("agency" in this context means the parent agency such as Treasury, not IRS), and who are selected from among the best qualified, shall receive a career or career conditional appointment, as appropriate. Agencies should use the authority ZBA-Pub.L. 106-117, Sec 511 for these appointments.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>What happens to veterans who were appointed under Schedule B?</summary>
                    <p>Agencies should first determine whether their Schedule B appointees actually competed under Merit Promotion procedures or were selected noncompetitively as a separate source of eligibles. Those veterans who competed under agency Merit Promotion procedures are to be converted to career conditional (or career) retroactive to the date of their original appointments. These individuals will have been serving probation as of the original date of their appointments and this must be made clear to the employees. Those veterans who did not compete under an agency Merit Promotion announcement and were given a Schedule B appointment noncompetitively, remain under Schedule B until such time as they can be appointed based on competition ? either under Merit Promotion procedures open to candidates outside the agency or through an open competitive announcement. Because an employee may remain under the Schedule B authority until such time as he or she is selected competitively, we are leaving the authority in place indefinitely; he or she may not be required to compete for a career conditional position.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Did the new amendments change the eligibility criteria for appointment under the VEOA?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. Prior to these amendments, a veteran had to be either a preference eligible or have at least 3 years of continuous active duty military service in order to qualify for appointment under the VEOA. The new amendments provide that OPM is authorized to regulate the circumstances under which individuals who were released from active duty "shortly before completing 3 years of active duty" may be appointed. In our interim regulations implementing this provision, we are proposing to use the term "substantially completed an initial 3-year term." Agencies will then decide, in individual cases, whether a candidate has met this standard. In general, most individuals completing an initial 3-year military tour are typically released a few days early. These individuals, if otherwise qualified, should be considered eligible.</p>

                    <summary>Are eligible veterans permitted to apply for vacancies that are open to CTAP candidates only?</summary>
                    <p>No. Since CTAP is limited to internal agency candidates, VEOA eligibles may not apply.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Are eligible veterans permitted to apply for vacancies that are open to ICTAP candidates only?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. Since ICTAP is open to candidates outside the agency, the law requires that VEOA eligibles be allowed to apply.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Do VEOA appointees serve a probationary period?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. Since they are appointed in the competitive service, they are subject to a probationary period. Please note, however, that for those employees converted from the Schedule B authority, prior service counts towards completion of probation provided it is in the same agency, same line of work, and without a break in service. Where applicable, agencies must inform individuals that their original appointment under the VEOA authority marked the beginning of a probationary period.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can a current career/career conditional employee who lacks time-in-grade apply as a VEOA candidate under an agency merit promotion announcement?</summary>
                    <p>No. Such an employee remains subject to time-in-grade restrictions. The VEOA is not a noncompetitive-entry authority like the VRA where an employee could be given a new appointment at a higher grade.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Can a current career/career conditional employee who meets time-in-grade and eligibility requirements apply as a VEOA candidate under an agency merit promotion announcement and, if selected, be given a new career/career conditional appointment using the VEOA appointing authority?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. Currently, a career/career conditional employee who meets time-in-grade and eligibility requirements would be able to apply directly to a merit promotion announcement without the need to use the VEOA authority. However, under the plain language of the VEOA, the law would allow current career/career conditional Federal employees who are preference eligibles or veterans meeting the eligibility criteria of the vacancy announcement to apply to those positions advertised under an agency's merit promotion procedures when seeking candidates from outside its own workforce. The term preference eligibles is defined in title 5, United States Code section 2108.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Can a current career/career conditional employee who meets time-in-grade and eligibility requirements apply as a VEOA candidate under an agency merit promotion announcement when he or she is outside the stated area of consideration?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. A career/career conditional employee who meets time-in-grade and eligibility requirements would be able to apply using VEOA to a merit promotion announcement when outside the stated area of consideration.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Can a preference eligible or eligible veteran who is outside the agency merit promotion announcement's area of consideration apply as a VEOA candidate?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. A preference eligible or eligible veteran would be able to apply using VEOA to a merit promotion announcement even though he or she is outside the vacancy announcement's area of consideration.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>We understand that VEOA eligibles are expected to compete with agency merit promotion eligibles under the agency's merit promotion plan. But, is the agency expected to create a different crediting plan for considering VEOA candidates?</summary>
                    <p>No. VEOA candidates are considered along with agency candidates, and under the same crediting plan.</p>
